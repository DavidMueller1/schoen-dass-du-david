        I recently completed my Master's degree in Media Informatics, a multidisciplinary field combining computer science, design, and user interaction. My passion lies in developing innovative software and hardware prototypes. I have experience in web development (front- and backend), mobile development (Android and Flutter), developing desktop applications, hardware prototyping, and some design skills.
